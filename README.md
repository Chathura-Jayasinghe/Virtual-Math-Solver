## Installation

To set up the project locally, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Chathura-Jayasinghe/Virtual-Math-Solver.git
   cd hand-gesture-math-solver
2. **Create a Virtual Environment**:
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`
3. **Install Dependencies**:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
   
4. **Run the Application**:
   ```bash
    streamlit run app.py

  
## Usage
Webcam Access: Ensure your webcam is connected and accessible.
Running the App: Use the checkbox to start the application.
Gesture Recognition: Solve math problems by writing them in the air using your hand gestures.
Output Display: The application provides an answer in the output area on the right.

## Features
Hand Gesture Recognition: Utilizes OpenCV's HandTrackingModule to recognize hand gestures for solving math problems.
AI Integration: Leverages the Gemini API to generate solutions based on user gestures.
User-Friendly Interface: A clean and interactive UI built with Streamlit for easy navigation.
Canvas Drawing: Draw math problems on a virtual canvas for the AI to process.

## Technologies Used
OpenCV: For computer vision tasks and hand gesture detection.
Gemini API: For AI-based content generation and problem-solving.
Streamlit: To create a user-friendly web application interface.
Python: The primary programming language used for development.

## Future Developments
Additional math functionalities and features.
Support for different types of math problems.
Enhanced gesture recognition accuracy.
